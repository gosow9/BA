\section{Hardware}
In this chapter we give a short oversight what hardware is used and how big the price tag of the demonstrator is. 

\subsection{Back-light}
The backlight consists of three glass panels of the size 2mm x 600mm x

\subsection{Computer}
The computer used is the Jetson Nano Developer Kit. a short technical overview of the Jetson Nano taken from the official website:https://developer.nvidia.com/embedded/jetson-nano-developer-kit \textbf{Ref}\\

\subsection{Demonstrator}
The demonstrator consists of three essential components. The framework that holds everything together, the backlight that illuminates from bottom to top and the Jetson nano with a camera. The Jetson nano is mounted on a 3d printed mount together with the camera. The camera is pointed directly at the backlight.  \\
The framework consists of 15 aluminum profiles which are all bolted together with angles. The framework is also by far the most expensive component of the entire prototype with xxx.
