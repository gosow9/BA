\subsection{Camera}
The camera used for this project had to following evaluation criteria to meet:
\begin{itemize}
	\item Compatible with the Jetson Nano enviroment
	\item A good developer community
	\item Open source drivers
	\item Low cost
\end{itemize}

Table \ref{development:cameras} lists some of the cameras that have been evaluated for the project.
