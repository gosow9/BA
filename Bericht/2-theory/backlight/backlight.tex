\section{Measurement with Backlight illumination}
Camera calibration is needed to obtain camera parameters like focal length and center point.
Further, it provides a method to correct distortions caused by the imperfect optics according to a certain distortion models.
For that, a set of images of a known pattern (usually a checkerboard) have to be taken from different view-points an angles.
These points provide the training data which is needed to estimate all the coefficients.

This section describes the theory behind the calibration process in OpenCV 4.3.0, which is the latest version at the time of writing this thesis.
