\section{Measurement with back-light illumination}
To measure the size and form of an object there are multiple ways. A popular way to get the contour is to place a light source behind the object desired to measure, and aim on the object with an camera. With this method the optical sensors get the silhouette of the object. In this section a short introduction to photometry and the typical construction of backlighting systems is discussed.
\subsection{Short introduction to photometry}
Photometry is the science concerned with the electromagnetic radiation visible to the human eye. In this section some important basics used further in this paper are explained. The theories of the following sections were taken from the textbook Physik 2 \cite{ruh}.
\subsubsection{Photometric quantities}
In principle the normal physical quantities and units such as watts and joules could be used for the measurements of light radiation. However, in order to take into account the spectral sensitivity of the human eye, special photometric quantities and units are introduced.\\

\begin{table}[ht]
\centering
\begin{tabular}{ |p{6cm} p{2cm}|p{6cm} p{2cm}|  }
	\hline
	\multicolumn{2}{|c}{Quantity}&\multicolumn{2}{|c|}{Unit} \\
	\hline\hline
	\multicolumn{1}{|c}{Name}			& \multicolumn{1}{|c|}{Symbol}	& \multicolumn{1}{c}{Name}	& \multicolumn{1}{|c|}{Symbol}	\\

	Luminous intensity 	& \multicolumn{1}{|c|}{$I_v$} 		& candela	& \multicolumn{1}{|c|}{cd}\\
	Luminance			& \multicolumn{1}{|c|}{$L_v$}		& candela/$\text{m}^2$	& \multicolumn{1}{|c|}{cd/$m^2$}\\
	Illuminace 			& \multicolumn{1}{|c|}{$E_v$} 		& lux (=lumen/$\text{m}^2$) 	& \multicolumn{1}{|c|}{lx}\\

	\hline
\end{tabular}
\end{table}

\subsubsection{Light source}
To model a light source it is assumed that the source is a very small point which emits the light rays in all directions which is measured in luminous flux. The density of the light rays is reduced with the factor $\frac{1}{r^2}$ with $r$ being the distance. Luminous intensity of the light is proportional to the density of the rays. This behavior has to do with the fact that the surface area $A$ of a sphere
\begin{align*}
A=\int_{0}^{2 \pi} \int_{0}^{\pi} r^{2} \sin \theta d \theta d \varphi=4 \pi r^{2}
\end{align*}
grows squared with the distance from the center $r$.
\begin{align*}
A = 4\pi r^2
\end{align*}

\end{figure} 
\\
\subsubsection{Solid angle}
In photometry the usage of solid angle is very common. For the following the concept of solid angle must be defined. A beam of rays emanates from a point zero. The area that this beam illuminates on a sphere with center zero and radius 1 is called solid angle and is designated $\Omega$.
If spherical coordinates $r$,$\theta$ and $\varphi$ are used, a differential solid angle element $d \Omega$ can be expressed as followed
\begin{align*}
d \Omega=\sin \theta d \theta d \varphi
\end{align*}
The differential solid angle element can now be integrated to obtain a surface with $\hat{r}$ being the unit vector of the radius.
\begin{align*}
\Omega=\iint_{S} \frac{\hat{r} \cdot \hat{n} d S}{r^{2}}=\iint_{S} \sin \theta d \theta d \varphi
\end{align*}
When defining the solid angle, a sphere with any radius $r$ can be used instead of the unit sphere. The area A cut out by the beam of rays on the surface of the sphere must then be divided by $r^2$.
\begin{align*}
\Omega=\frac{A}{r^{2}}
\end{align*}
Solid angle is a dimensionless quantity.  

\subsubsection{Luminous flux}
Luminous flux or lumen is Luminous flux per unit time and has the unit candela steradians ($cd\cdot sr$). It is used to describe the total amount of light a lamp puts out and is named lumen (lm). To better understand how bright a lumen is there is a list with example values. \\


\begin{tabular}{ |p{12cm} p{2cm}|  }
		\hline
		& $\Phi_v$ in lm\\
		
		
		\hline
		LED		& 500\\
		Light bulb, 220 V, 60W		& 730\\
		Light bulb, 220 V, 100W		& 1'380\\
		Fluorescent tube, 220 V, 40W		& 2'300\\
		Mercury vapor lamp, 220 V, 125W		& 5'400\\
		Mercury vapor lamp, 220 V, 2000W		& 125'000\\
		\hline
\end{tabular}



\subsubsection{Luminous intensity}
Luminous intensity or candela is the Luminous flux per unit solid angle. It describes the perceived power per unit solid angle. As example we assume to have a light with a 10 lumen strong light source. If the light beam is now focused into 1 steradian light beam, the beam would be 10 candela.\\

\subsubsection{Luminance}
Luminace is the Luminous intensity per area of the luminous area. It is often used to measure reflections or emissions from flat, diffuse surfaces. For a human it describes how bright a surface appears to be and is used in different industries to to characterize how bright something is. Like the brightness of a display. 
\begin{align*}
L_{\mathrm{v}}=\frac{\mathrm{d}^{2} \Phi_{\mathrm{v}}}{\mathrm{d} \Sigma \mathrm{d} \Omega_{\Sigma} \cos \theta_{\Sigma}}
\end{align*}\\
where $\mathrm{d}^{2} \Phi_{\mathrm{v}}$ is the luminous flux leaving the infinitesimal area $d\Sigma$ inside the infinitesimal solid angle $d\Omega_\Sigma$ with the angle $\theta_{\Sigma}$ between the normal $\mathbf{n}_{\Sigma}$ and the surface $d\Sigma$ in specified direction. \\
To get a better understanding how bright something is here are some values for comparison.\\


\begin{tabular}{ |p{11cm} p{3cm}|  }
		\hline
		& $L_v$ in c/$\text{m}^2$\\
		
		
		\hline
		Computer display					& $50...300$\\
		Fluorescent tube					& $10^4$\\
		Frosted light bulb					& $10^4...10^5$\\
		Tungsten filament of a light bulb	& $10^7...2\cdot 10^7$\\
		Arc lamp							& $1.5\cdot10^8...1.8\cdot10^8$\\
		High pressure mercury lamp			& $2.5\cdot10^8...10^9$\\
		Sun									& $1.2\cdot10^9$\\
		Xenon high pressure lamp			& $10^9...10^10$\\
		
		\hline
\end{tabular}




\subsubsection{Illuminace}
Illuminace describes the the total luminous flux per unit area a surface receives. It is also known as lux (lx) or lumen per square meter. It should not be called brightness to prevent confusion with other quantities as mean luminace. Some examples of illuminace are in the following table.\\

\begin{tabular}{ |p{11cm} p{3cm}|  }
		\hline
		& $E_v$ in lx\\
		
		
		\hline
		Sun light in summer					& 70'000\\
		Sun light in winter					& 5'500\\
		Day light with clouded sky			& 1'000-2'000\\
		Full moon night						& 0.25\\
		Stars without moon clear sky		& 0.001\\
		Limit of color perception			& 3\\
		Streetlight							& 1-30\\
		Living room							& 40-150\\
		Working room						& 40-300\\
		Working place lightning				& 100-4000\\
		
		\hline
\end{tabular}

\subsection{Backlight illumination}
The principle of backlight illumination is straight forward. By placing an object in front of an light source the camera gets the silhouette of an object. \\

\end{figure}

If now an object is placed directly on a light source shaped as a flat surface, each infinitesimal area of the surface is a light source point. From each point the light rays spread in all directions. If an object is now placed right on the backlight it is possible that the object displays shade effects on the edges. This happens because of the light points on the side of the backlight illuminating the objects surface from the side and not only from the back. In the image \ref{theory:close} the effect of the shaded edges can be clearly seen. To reduce this effect the object can be placed further away from the light source. With this action the further away rays have a smaller illuminace effect on the edges of the object, thus reducing the shading effect and giving us a much better contrast of the edges. In the picture \ref{theory:far} the light plate is 8cm away which leads the less stray light and sharp edges.

\begin{figure}[ht]

	\caption{Comparison of an object close \ref{theory:close} to the backlight and far \ref{theory:far} away to the backlight\label{theory:thre}}	
\end{figure}



Another way to control stray light is to work with so called light control filters. This filters are build in a way only light rays orthogonal to the filter can pass. Thus removing the stray light from the side and giving much sharper edges.\\

	\includegraphics[width=\linewidth]{2-theory/backlight/Light_Control_Film_principle.png}
	\caption{Principle of a light control film\label{theory:filter}}	
\end{figure}


The disadvantage of this method is that the luminance after the filter is way less than before the filter. Leading to a darker image or the use of an even brighter backlight. This effect is visible in the image comparison \ref{theory:filtercompare}.
